# omeka-image-display

A simple plugin for [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) that adds an improved
image display layout to exhibits.

## Compilation

To compile the project, [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) and
[Google closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) are
required, with executables named `stylus` and `closure` in the PATH
respectively (the google closure compiler can be wrapped inside a bash
script that executes the jar and passes all arguments).

Then, simply execute `make` in the root directory of the project.
